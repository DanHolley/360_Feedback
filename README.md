# 360_Feedback

Welcome to the 360 Feedback report-generator tool, created by MSgt Marszalek. This tool was built using Python 3.8.3 and is inteded to be run from the iLab, in Jupyter. 

This file explains how to use the tool, including:
1. How to launch it
2. Where to put your input file so that the tool automatically locates it
3. How to run the program to generate an Airman's 360 Feedback report
4. Where to find your export file, and
5. Best practices for ensuring privacy, including how to manage sensitive files after you've generated a report

## 1: Launching the Tool

Jupyter Notebook will launch in the default browser. 

Double-click the file named "Kara's 360 Feedback.ipynb" to launch the tool.

## 2: Uploading Your Input Excel File to the Environment

For the tool to work, it needs access to the Excel file for the Airman whose 360 Feedback report you aim to generate. To ensure this, save your file in the "Input_360_Files" folder, which can be accessed via the following path: 

Finder -> Documents -> KMM -> 360_Feedback -> Input_360_Files
